# K-means-algorithm-convergence-process
### This project will demonstrate how K-means algorithm  works by showing the process of  convergence
# DataSet
the cdata.csv is a modified version of the iris dataset
In order to demonstrate the process more clearly and efficiently 
we modified the iris dataset to cdata, which  is smaller than the origin one 
# Algorithm Details
first , we randomly select k points as centroid , and update the point with the closlest centroid 
Keep doing the process above , until the centroid are fixed.
# How to find a best number of  clustering  k?
We can determine the number K  ploting with the Mse and k
Which is called **"Elbow Method"**
